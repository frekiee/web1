  <br><p><strong>Scotland</strong><br>Pancakes (also called Scotch pancakes or Scottish pancakes) are more
    like the American type. In parts of Scotland they are also referred to as
    drop scones or dropped scones.[41][42][43] They are made from flour, eggs,
    sugar, buttermilk or milk, salt, bicarbonate of soda and cream of tartar.[41][42][43] Smaller than American or English pancakes at about 3.5 in / 9 cm in diameter, they are made by the traditional method of dropping batter onto a griddle (a girdle in Northumberland or in Scots). They can be served with jam and cream or just with butter. In Scotland pancakes are generally served at teatime.</p>
