<h1>What is Pancake?</h1> -"Happy New 2021 with <strong>FANTASTIC</strong> Pancakes!!!"
  <br><p>A <strong>pancake</strong> (or <u>hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack,</u> not
    to be confused with oat bar flapjacks) is a flat cake, often thin and round,
    prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and
    cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil
     or butter. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably the
      earliest and most widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies.</p>

      <p>The pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide. In the United Kingdom,
        pancakes are often unleavened and resemble a crêpe.[2] In North America,
        a leavening agent is used (typically baking powder) creating a thick fluffy
         pancake. A crêpe is a thin Breton pancake of French origin cooked on one
         or both sides in a special pan or crepe maker to achieve a lacelike
         network of fine bubbles. A well-known variation originating from
          southeast Europe is a palačinke, a thin moist pancake fried on both
          sides and filled with jam, cream cheese, chocolate, or ground walnuts,
          but many other fillings—sweet or savoury—can also be used.</p>
