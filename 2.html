<h1>Pancake Day</h1> -"Happy New 2021 with <strong>FANTASTIC</strong> Pancakes!!!"
  <br><p>Pancakes are traditionally eaten on Shrove Tuesday, which is known as "Pan
    cake Day" in Canada,[58] the United Kingdom,[59] Ireland,[60] New Zealand,
     and Australia,[61] and "Pancake Tuesday" in Ireland and Scotland. (Shrove
      Tuesday is better known in the United States, France, and other countries
       as Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday.) Historically, pancakes were made on Shrove
        Tuesday so that the last of the fat or lard was used up before Lent. No
        meat products should be eaten during Lent.Charity and school events are
        organized on Pancake Day: in a "pancake race" each participant carries a
         pancake in a frying pan. All runners must toss their pancakes as they run
          and catch them in the frying pan. This event is said to have originated
          in Olney, England in 1445 when a housewife was still busy frying pancakes
           to eat before the Lenten fast when she heard the bells of St Peter and
           St Paul's Church calling her to the Shriving Service. Eager to get to
           church, she ran out of her house still holding the frying pan complete
           with pancake, tossing it to prevent it from burning, and still wearing
            her apron and headscarf.[62][63] Every Shrove Tuesday since 1950, the
            towns of Olney[64] and Liberal, Kansas have competed in the Internatio
            nal Pancake Race. Only local women may compete; they race, and their
            times are compared to determine the international winner. In Olney
            the main women's race is augmented by races for local schoolchildren
             and for men. The Rehab UK Parliamentary Pancake Race takes
         place every Shrove Tuesday, with teams from the British lower house
         (the House of Commons), the upper house (the House of Lords), and the
         Fourth Estate, contending for the title of Parliamentary Pancake Race
         Champions. The fun relay race is to raise awareness of the work of the
          national brain injury charity, Rehab UK, and the needs of people with
           acquired brain injury.[65][66]</p>
